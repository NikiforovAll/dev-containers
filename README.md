ðŸš§ WIP, source <https://github.com/NikiforovAll/vscode-dev-containers/tree/nikiforovall-dotnet/containers/nikiforovall-dotnet>

> Consider to replicate dev-container definition as soon as tooling is available and it is possible to build dev-container out of definition, for now. Let's keep dev-container definition in original repo as fork.

## .NET Core dev-container ðŸ“¦

Summary: .NET Core SDK, zsh + oh-my-zsh / bash.
