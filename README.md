# Repository Development Containers ![.github/workflows/push-dev.yml](https://github.com/NikiforovAll/dev-containers/workflows/.github/workflows/push-dev.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

WIP: <https://github.com/NikiforovAll/vscode-dev-containers/tree/nikiforovall-dotnet/containers/nikiforovall-dotnet>

* Consider to replicate dev-container definition as soon as tooling is available and it is possible to build dev-container out of definition, for now. Let's keep dev-container definition in original repo as fork.
