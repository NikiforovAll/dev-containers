## Dotfiles

Containers above provide basis and dependencies for dotfiles [https://github.com/NikiforovAll/dotfiles/tree/master/src/dev-container](https://github.com/NikiforovAll/dotfiles/tree/master/src/dev-container)

Configure it like this:

```text
~/dotfiles/src/dev-container/boot/install.sh
https://github.com/NikiforovAll/dotfiles.git
~/dotfiles
```

## Highlights

* Every container is based on common setup that includes:
  * themed bash, zsh. This depends on dotfiles.
  * fzf ‚≠ê
    * CTRL-T, CTRL-R, ALT-C
    * fzf-extras
  * fd
  * silversearcher-ag, could be invoked as ag.
  * lnav
  * exa, aliased as ll.
  * autosuggestions: fzf-tab | zsh-autosuggestions

If you use my dotfiles, please see <https://github.com/NikiforovAll/dotfiles/tree/master/src/dev-container/shell> for more details.

## Known issues

* exa requires locale, but dev container doesn't have it. "Unable to determine time zone: No such file or directory (os error 2)"
* [MAJOR] non-root user scenario is not tested
* exercism image builds with some errors

üöß WIP, Tool chain could be improved based on official impl <https://github.com/NikiforovAll/vscode-dev-containers/tree/nikiforovall-dotnet/containers/nikiforovall-dotnet>

> Consider to replicate dev-container definition as soon as tooling is available and it is possible to build dev-container out of definition, for now. Let's keep dev-container definition in original repo as fork.

### TODO:

* consider to add fasd and fzf-tab to other dev-containers. Right now, it could be found only in dotnet.
